# Textsynth Wrapper

_Easy-to-use Python wrapper for the TextSynth API_

## What is this?

This is a simple Python library that handles interactions with the
[TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/) API. It handles authentication, wraps
requests and responses, and validates the data you pass to TextSynth.
