TextSynth Python Interface
==========================

This is a simple Python library that handles interactions with the `TextSynth
<https://textsynth.com/>`_ API. It handles authentication, wraps requests and
responses, and validates the data you pass to TextSynth.

See the `TextSynth documentation <https://textsynth.com/documentation.html>`_
for an up-to-date reference on the underlying API and capabilities of
TextSynth.
